# employee-database-tracker
A command line application that allows a user to add, update, and view employee and company data in a database.

## Description

- I was motivated to create this application because it was a great opportunity to test my abilities with SQL and adding, updating, and viewing very specific things and rendering it on the command line for the users.
- I created this project to work on my Node JS, SQL, Inquirer, and general Javascript skills, particularly when it comes to using SQL queries to view very specific data and allow a user to modify the database.
- By creating this application, I solved the problem of a user needing to have develop skills in order to see and modify the database. A user can now make changes without needing background coding knowledge.
- Through doing this activity, I learned more about using javascript in Node JS and creating SQL queries that can make changes to a database from a user command.

## Installation

- In order to use this application, the user will need to have access to the command line.
- Once they are in the command line, they will need to cd into the employee-database-tracker directory.
- Once in the folder, the user will have to run npm start in the command line.
- From there, the user will be prompted to answer questions that will in turn make changes 

## Usage

- The use of this command line application is to edit, view, or add to a database.

- When the user starts the application using npm start, they are then prompted with questions to see how they would like to see or edit the database.
- When a user selects an option for viewing or editing specific areas of the database, they will then possibly be asked follow up questions to determine how to edit the database.
- The user will then be able to see the changes they have made within the database
